# Verify and Sync

Sometimes it can be nice to have the rings done automatically for you. Therefore, you can use the Verify and Sync commands.

## Verify

To begin, use the <mark style="color:green;">`/sync`</mark> command with the required parameter for the social platform you want to link, in this case, `social:kick`. The basic command is `/sync social:kick`.

### How to?

Use the <mark style="color:green;">`/sync`</mark> command and a embed will show.&#x20;

The embed will tell you what to do.&#x20;

1. Copy the code. This is a personal code that will change from person to person. This code is essential for the linking process and will be valid for 5 minutes.
2. Now, go to the "Noti" channel in your Discord server. You can find this channel in the server's channel list.
3. In the "Noti" channel, paste the code you copied earlier. You can either find the code provided in the bot's message or visit [https://kick.com/noti](https://kick.com/noti) to get the code.
4. After successfully pasting the code, Noti Bot will send a success message in the same "Noti" channel. This message confirms that your account is now linked!
5. From now on, your account will be automatically synced the moment you join the server.

If you ever need to reset the linking process, you can use the `/sync` command again with the <mark style="color:orange;">`reset:true`</mark> option, like this:

* <mark style="color:orange;">`/sync social:kick reset:true`</mark>

## Panel

You can setup a panel to make it easier for your users to verify or sync.&#x20;

Use the <mark style="color:green;">`/panel syncronize`</mark> command and Noti will post a embed like the picture below.&#x20;
